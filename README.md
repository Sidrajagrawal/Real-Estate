How to Get Your API Keys and App Passwords
üèûÔ∏è Cloudinary Setup
Visit Cloudinary: Go to the official Cloudinary website: https://cloudinary.com/

Sign Up / Log In: Create a free account or log in if you already have one.

Access Dashboard: Once logged in, navigate to your Dashboard.

Find API Credentials: On your dashboard, you'll typically see your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret prominently displayed. Copy these values and paste them into your .env file.

üìß Gmail App Password for Email Verification
For your Django application to send emails via Gmail, you need to use an App Password instead of your regular Gmail account password, especially if you have 2-Step Verification enabled (which is highly recommended for security).

Enable 2-Step Verification (if not already enabled):

Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/

In the left navigation panel, click Security.

Under "Signing in to Google," find "2-Step Verification" and turn it on by following the on-screen prompts. You'll typically verify a phone number.

Generate an App Password:

After enabling 2-Step Verification, go back to the Security page in your Google Account.

Under "How you sign in to Google," click on App passwords. (If you don't see this, ensure 2-Step Verification is fully set up, or try searching for "App passwords" in the Google Account search bar).

You might be asked to re-enter your Google password.

In the "Select app" dropdown, choose "Mail".

In the "Select device" dropdown, choose "Other (Custom name)" and type a name like "Django Backend" or "Real Estate App".

Click Generate.

A 16-character app password will be displayed (e.g., abcd efgh ijkl mnop). Copy this password immediately, as it will not be shown again.

Paste this generated password into the EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD variable in your .env file.
